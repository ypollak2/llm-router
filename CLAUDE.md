# LLM Router — Project Instructions

## Auto-Routing Rule

When a user's task would clearly benefit from an external LLM — research requiring web access, content generation, deep analysis beyond your training data, or code generation that could leverage a specialized model — **automatically use the appropriate `llm_*` MCP tool** without the user needing to type `/route`.

### Decision Matrix

| Signal in user prompt | Action |
|---|---|
| Research, current events, "what's the latest" | `llm_research` |
| "Write", "draft", "create content", brainstorming | `llm_generate` |
| Deep analysis, compare, evaluate, debug complex logic | `llm_analyze` |
| "Generate code", "implement", "refactor" (for external model) | `llm_code` |
| Simple factual question, quick lookup | `llm_query` |
| Image/visual request | `llm_image` |
| Multi-step pipeline | `llm_orchestrate` |

### When NOT to auto-route

- Tasks you can handle directly (file edits, git operations, shell commands)
- Questions about this codebase specifically (use Read/Grep instead)
- When the user explicitly asks YOU to do something, not an external LLM

### Routing Hint

If a `[ROUTE: <task_type>/<complexity> via <method>]` hint appears in the conversation context, use it to select the right tool and skip re-classification. The hint is injected by the UserPromptSubmit hook's multi-layer classifier:

1. `via heuristic` — High-confidence pattern match (instant, free)
2. `via ollama` — Local LLM classification via qwen3.5 (~1s, free)
3. `via api` — Cheap API classification via Gemini Flash/GPT-4o-mini (~$0.0001)
4. `via heuristic-weak` — Low-confidence pattern match
5. `via fallback` — No classification; `llm_route` should do full analysis

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -x -q

# Lint
uv run ruff check src/ tests/

# Run single test
uv run pytest tests/test_classifier.py -x -q

# Build
uv build

# Run server locally
uv run llm-router
```

## Architecture

- `src/llm_router/server.py` — MCP tool definitions (FastMCP, 24 tools)
- `src/llm_router/router.py` — Core routing with fallback chains + context compaction
- `src/llm_router/classifier.py` — LLM-based complexity classification
- `src/llm_router/model_selector.py` — Budget-aware model selection
- `src/llm_router/profiles.py` — Routing tables per profile/task_type
- `src/llm_router/types.py` — All dataclasses and enums (frozen)
- `src/llm_router/config.py` — Pydantic settings from env vars
- `src/llm_router/cost.py` — SQLite usage tracking + savings persistence
- `src/llm_router/health.py` — Circuit breaker per provider + rate limit detection
- `src/llm_router/claude_usage.py` — Live Claude subscription monitoring
- `src/llm_router/provider_budget.py` — External provider budgets
- `src/llm_router/codex_agent.py` — Local Codex integration
- `src/llm_router/cache.py` — Prompt classification cache (SHA-256 + LRU)
- `src/llm_router/compaction.py` — Structural context compaction (5 strategies)
- `src/llm_router/quality.py` — Routing decision logging + quality reports
- `src/llm_router/install_hooks.py` — Global hook installer (CLI + MCP action)
- `src/llm_router/hooks/` — Bundled hook scripts (auto-route, usage-refresh)
- `src/llm_router/rules/` — Global routing rules for Claude Code

## Patterns

- All dataclasses are `frozen=True` — never mutate, create new instances
- All routing/API calls are `async def`
- Budget pressure is applied fresh per call (never cached)
- Classification results ARE cached (complexity doesn't change with budget)
- MCP tools return formatted strings, not structured data
