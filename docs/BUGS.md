# Bugs

One entry per bug: symptom, cause, fix, and the test that keeps it closed. A bug that is
found but not fixed yet is listed with its **Status** and the task that fixes it; its test
line then names the test that task must add, not one that exists. Numbers carry their n and
source. Counts from the owner's machine are read from `~/.llm-router` and the 2026-10-06
`llm-router kpi --days 7 --json` run on c2ed278, unless a line says otherwise.

## 1. NULL `session_id` on local routing rows

- **Symptom.** O3 printed "local share unknown". In `usage.db`, 0 of 544 runtime
  `routing_decisions` rows had a `session_id`, including 444 Ollama-served rows (111 of them
  in the 7 days to 2026-10-06; #288 body, read-only on the live `usage.db`). A local answer
  could not be scoped to an organic session, so no local KPI could count it.
- **Cause.** The router's finalizer wrote `routing_decisions` without a session id. The hook
  payload carried one, and the hook accepted it and then dropped it.
- **Fix.** #288 (`feat/local-session-accepted`): stamp `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` from the MCP
  server's own env, only inside an MCP tool call, and the hook payload's id on the hook path.
  A row without a trustworthy id stays NULL; the global `current_session.json` pointer is not
  used, because with two sessions open it names the wrong one. Open at the time of writing.
- **Test.** M0-3: at least 19 of 20 synthetic rows carry the calling session's own id across 2
  concurrent research sessions. #288 carries its own tests (a fresh pointer with no env stores
  NULL). The hook payload's id is pinned on all three agent-route ledger paths (DIRECT, NS3
  Codex, Phase 2 CLI delegation) by `test_every_agent_route_ledger_path_stamps_the_payload_session`;
  a review mutation that passed main()'s own pointer-backed `session_id` to two of the three had
  survived until that test was added. Not on `main` yet.

## 2. O3 counted more turns than the user typed

- **Symptom.** In session b9f04425, 424 proxy turns against 370 typed prompts in the
  transcript, a ratio of 1.146 (research findings, W0). The O3 integrity bar is 0.90-1.10.
- **Cause.** Two kinds of rows were read as human turns: first calls of sub-agents (sidechain
  transcripts), and local MCP answers from `usage.db` (they happen inside a Claude turn, so
  they are not turns).
- **Fix.** Plan task M0.3: sub-agent first calls are excluded and counted in
  `o3.excluded.subagent_first`; MCP local units are reported as `o3.breakdown.local_assist_n`,
  outside both sides of the rate.
- **Test.** `tests/test_offload_share_alignment.py` (to be added by M0.3), plus the
  integrity check `o3_integrity.py --since --until` on W0: pooled and per-session ratio in
  0.90-1.10. Not on `main` yet.

## 3. NS and D2 counted a heuristic "used"

- **Symptom.** The owner's rule is that Q&A never counts toward NS and that "used" needs a
  passing test. The code did not enforce it: seven heuristic setters in `northstar.py`
  (lines 614-1266 on c2ed278) mark units `used` from transcript signals, whatever the task
  type, and NS counts `outcome == "used"`.
- **Cause.** "Used" was inferred from behaviour (a draft accepted, a tool result reused),
  not from a verified result.
- **Fix.** Plan task M0.2: strict rule (served by a non-Claude model, `verify_status` in
  {`pass_f2p`, `pass_f2p_model`}, not Q&A, not redone); the heuristic figure stays as
  `NS_heuristic` / `D2_heuristic`, labelled "not a target".
- **Test.** `tests/test_kpi_strict_used.py`, 11 cases (to be added by M0.2). Not on `main`
  yet. Until then, `docs/repo_goals/KPIS.md` says NS is the heuristic one.

## 4. `G1_proxy` printed 0 ms

- **Symptom.** `llm-router kpi` showed the proxy half of G1 as 0 ms (primary plan, source
  [K]), although the ledger's `tier_decision_s` had p50 4 ms and p95 83 ms for turn-first
  calls (W0, organic plus research sessions, n=1,181).
- **Cause.** `_g1_proxy` took the p95 of `added_latency_s`. That field is 0.0 on 25,924 of
  25,963 forwarded rows (all-time copy of the ledger, 2026-10-07): it is set only on a few
  decision paths. The time the tier decision took is in `tier_decision_s`.
- **Fix.** `commands/kpi.py` `_g1_proxy` now reports p50 and p95 of `tier_decision_s`, with
  n, for turn-first and continuation calls apart. Side calls are left out and counted. A
  segment below n=50 prints `too few to tell`.
- **Test.** `tests/test_kpi_command.py::test_g1_proxy_reports_tier_decision_s_split_turn_first_and_continuation`
  (exact p50/p95 on a fixture ledger), `test_g1_proxy_is_never_zero_when_forwarded_rows_added_nothing`
  (the regression itself) and `test_g1_proxy_thin_segment_says_too_few_and_missing_field_is_not_measurable`.
  The pinned goldens `tests/golden/kpi_pre_o3_*` were updated for the one reason string that
  changed (`added_latency_s` to `tier_decision_s`); nothing else in them moved.

## 5. Haiku 400 on a mid-conversation system message

- **Symptom.** A live smoke call to Haiku 4.5 returned `invalid_request_error`: "role
  'system' is not supported on this model".
- **Cause.** Claude Code 2.1.285 sent a `role: "system"` entry inside `messages` on every
  call (docstring of `_has_mid_conversation_system_message`, `proxy/tiers.py`). Haiku 4.5
  rejects the role. Nobody has re-checked the current Claude Code version. The ledger has 0
  `haiku_rewrite` rows, ever.
- **Fix.** The body is excluded from the Haiku rewrite when it carries such a message, so
  today the path cannot fire for those bodies. `haiku_rewrite` is suspended in the live
  tier config until the M2 canary (owner decision D-15). #289 logs `has_mid_system` and
  `tier_haiku_block` per row, so the prevalence is measured. The fold (rewrite the body so
  Haiku accepts it) is plan task M0.7, behind a flag that stays off.
- **Test.** Existing: `tests/test_proxy_tiers.py` (the body-eligibility tests). M0.7 adds a smoke on a separate proxy port: at least 19 of 20
  Haiku-decided calls served with no `tier_retry`.

## 6. Research session b9f04425 counted as organic

- **Symptom.** One session supplied 1,175 of the 1,183 organic turn-first rows in W0
  (99.3%) and 81.4% of the NS units, while p_eval had excluded it as "this research
  session". Without it, W0 holds 8 organic turn-first rows from 2 sessions.
- **Cause.** The session was never tagged research: 424 of its rows were stamped organic,
  751 had no stamp, and its tag file said organic. The ledgers are append-only, so the
  stamps could not be corrected.
- **Fix.** #291 (M0.0b): `~/.llm-router/session_kind_overrides.json`
  (`{session_id: {kind, reason}}`), read by every reader with precedence override, tag file,
  then the row's own stamp. The live file holds one entry, for b9f04425. With it,
  `llm-router kpi --since 2026-09-29T09:41:51Z --until 2026-10-06T09:41:52Z` counts 59 organic
  NS units (25 backfilled); with `--include research` the count is 5,914 (2026-10-07, copy of
  `~/.llm-router`).
- **Test.** `tests/test_session_kind_override.py` (an override beats the tag file, the
  `KindIndex` stamp and the ledger stamp; a session without an override is unchanged).
  Executor sessions: `exec_sessions_check.py` must print 0 organic.

## 7. `edit_outcomes.jsonl` rows with no source

- **Symptom.** A local edit made by `llm_edit` (inside a Claude turn) and one made by the
  zero-Claude hook (the whole turn served locally) look the same in `edit_outcomes.jsonl`,
  so O3 could not count the second as a local turn without also counting the first.
- **Cause.** `edit_ledger.record_edit_outcome` writes ts, session_id (from the global
  pointer), session_kind, file, model, applied and survived. It has no `source` and no
  `turn_id`, and the session id is a guess from the pointer file.
- **Fix.** Plan task M0.3(c): `source` in {`zero_claude`, `llm_edit`}, the hook payload's own
  session id, and `turn_id`; O3 counts one local turn per (session_id, turn_id) among applied
  `zero_claude` rows, and never counts `llm_edit` rows as turns.
- **Test.** `tests/test_offload_share_alignment.py` (to be added by M0.3): a turn that
  edits 2 files is 1 turn; an `llm_edit` row is no turn; a `zero_claude` row does not match
  or drop an `llm_edit` unit in `northstar._fold_edit_ledger`. Not on `main` yet.

## P09-2. Proxy tier decision took 1.2-2.2 s on rules-only turn-first calls

- **Symptom.** `tier_decision_s` was 1.208, 2.203 and 1.673 s on 3 of 6 live turn-first
  rows (reasons haiku_rewrite, sticky, thinking_floor), against the PRD's 50 ms heuristic
  bar [PL] (`$PP/v16/sources/PL_proxy_calls_since_20261007T1140Z.jsonl`, n = 15 rows).
- **Cause.** Not the quota read (the plan's first hypothesis: `proxy.quota_pressure` parses
  `usage.json` once per mtime and costs one `stat()` per call). The tier decision's
  classifier was `backends.choose_model`, which builds a provider chain
  (`router._build_and_filter_chain`: usage.db queries, dynamic routing, the Ollama model
  list) on each new (task_type, complexity) key, inside the timed span. The decision reads
  only the class. Measured on a copy of the live usage.db (2026-10-07, this machine under
  load): first build 21.6 s, later new keys 67-107 ms, `classify_signals` 0.1-0.2 ms.
- **Fix.** `backends.tier_classify`: the same `classify_signals(GATEWAY_POLICY)` class, chain
  head only from the cache, never a build. The decision now writes `tier_phases_ms`
  (`classify`, `quota_read`, `stickiness`, `haiku_checks`; `okf_attach` and `fold` beside it).
- **Test.** `tests/test_p09_proxy_decision.py`:
  `test_a_turn_first_decision_never_waits_on_a_chain_build` (a 1 s fake chain build; FAILS
  on da31df7), `test_tier_classify_gives_the_same_class_as_choose_model`,
  `test_a_slow_chain_build_does_not_reach_tier_decision_s`.

## 8. `DISABLE_LLM_CLASSIFIERS` auto-detect turns the hook's Ollama layer off

- **Symptom.** With `LLM_ROUTER_CLASSIFY_LOCAL_ONLY` and `LLM_ROUTER_DISABLE_LLM_CLASSIFIERS`
  both unset, the hook's LLM classifier layer is off whenever Ollama is reachable.
- **Cause.** `hooks/auto-route.py` (line 374 on this commit):
  `DISABLE_LLM_CLASSIFIERS = _ollama_reachable or not _has_api_key`. The comment above it says
  local-only means "heuristic + Ollama", but this flag also gates layer 2 (Ollama, line 2435), so
  the Ollama layer is off exactly when Ollama is reachable. Layer 3 (API, line 2445) is off with it.
- **Fix.** None. Recorded as known and not fixed: the hook stays byte-identical until a task
  that changes hooks (M3.4 / M4) owns it. Running with the variable set explicitly to `false`
  avoids the auto-detect.
- **Test.** None yet. A fix needs a test that, with both variables unset and Ollama
  reachable, asserts the value the owner chooses.

## 9. Classifier warm-up loaded `llmr-classifier` at the wrong `num_ctx`

- **Symptom.** The first real classification after a warm-up still cost a model reload. In
  `~/.ollama/logs/server.log` (Ollama 0.32.11, `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=131072`), the alias's
  blob `sha256-dec52a44...` started at `-c 32768` at 2026-10-07 09:52:06 (+01:00), then
  restarted at `-c 4096` at 09:52:32 (26 s later, the real call evicting the warm runner); the
  same pair repeated at 09:55:27 and 09:56:03 (n=2 pairs). A reload is about 5 s against a
  2.0 s budget (D-4), so the call that should have been fast timed out.
- **Cause.** `_warm` posted `/api/chat` with no `options`, and Ollama loaded the alias at its
  own default context. The real call (`_payload`) always sends `num_ctx 4096`. Ollama treats a
  different `num_ctx` as a different runner, so the warm runner was evicted, not reused.
  `_is_loaded` also reported any resident `llmr-classifier` as warm, whatever its
  `context_length`, so an alias left at 32768 skipped the warm-up and the first real call paid
  the reload inside its budget.
- **Fix.** `src/llm_router/local_classifier.py`: `_warm` and `_payload` both take
  `_options()`, so the two requests cannot drift apart. `_is_loaded` returns False for a
  model resident at a `context_length` other than `NUM_CTX`, so the call reports `cold` and the
  warm-up reloads it at 4096. A server that does not report `context_length` is taken at its
  word. Not re-run against the live server (the shared Ollama was left undisturbed); the
  loopback tests are the proof.
- **Test.** In `tests/test_local_classifier.py`:
  `test_cold_model_is_reported_and_warmed_once_per_30_seconds` asserts
  `warm[0]["options"]["num_ctx"] == lc.NUM_CTX == 4096`;
  `test_resident_at_the_wrong_context_is_cold_not_a_reload_inside_the_budget` asserts that an
  alias resident at 32768 returns `cold` with no chat call and one warm-up at 4096, and that
  4096 and an omitted `context_length` return `llm`. Mutants run on head 2316f3f: warm-up
  without `options` fails both tests; `_is_loaded` returning True regardless of context fails
  the second.
